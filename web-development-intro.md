# What is Web Development?
Web development is the process of building websites and web applications that run on the internet. It includes everything from static webpages (like a blog) to complex platforms (like Amazon or Gmail).

# 3 Layers of Web Development
### 1. Frontend (Client-Side)
What users see and interact with (the browser part).

#### Built with:
* HTML - structure (like headings, paragraphs)
* CSS - style (fonts, colors, layout)
* JavaScript - behavior (buttons, animations, interactive forms)

#### Popular tools/frameworks:
* React, Vue, Svelte, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap

### 2. Backend (Server-Side)
Powers the app behind the scenes â€” handles business logic, databases, authentication, etc.

#### Languages & frameworks:
* JavaScript (Node.js + Express)
* Python (Flask, Django)
* Ruby (Rails)
* PHP (Laravel)
* Java, Go, Rust, etc.

### 3. Database
Stores and retrieves data (e.g., user info, posts, orders).

#### Common types:
* Relational: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite
* NoSQL: MongoDB, Firebase

# How They Work Together
When you visit a website:
1. **Frontend**: Your browser requests the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
2. **Backend**: The server processes the request, runs logic, and interacts with the database if needed.
3. **Database**: If data is needed, the backend queries the database.
4. **Response**: The backend sends the data back to the frontend, which renders it for you to see.

# Shubble's Web Development Stack
Shubble uses a modern stack that includes:
* **Frontend**: React for building user interfaces.
* **Backend**: Flask (Python) for handling server logic and API requests.
* **Database**: PostgreSQL for storing shuttle data and user information.
